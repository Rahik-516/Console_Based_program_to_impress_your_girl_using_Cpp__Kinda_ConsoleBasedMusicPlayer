I have tried to sync the lyrics with the music, though it is not perfect but itis still good to go, i guess.

However, if you want to run this program in your IDE, then you must do the following things.

1. Convert the .mp3 file into .wav file in your directory. (I have uploaded the .mp3 file of the music here, that is why you have to do it)

2. It is suggested to use the Code::Blocks IDE to execute/run this program. Make thhe following changes in your code::blocks IDE:

    
-- To play sound in a C++ program using the PlaySound function from the winmm library on Code::Blocks, you need to ensure a few things:
Link the Required Library:
You need to link the winmm.lib library, which contains the necessary multimedia functions. Here is how, you can do it:
1. Open your project in Code::Blocks.
2. Go to Project -> Build Options.
3. Select the project name under the Selected Compiler settings.
4. Click on the Linker settings tab.
In the Link libraries section, click Add.
5. Type winmm (without quotes) and click OK.
Ensure the WAV File is in the Correct Location:

Make sure the .wav file (Onek kore pabo.wav) is in the same directory as your executable or provide the full path to the file.


Build and run your program from Code::Blocks. If everything is set up correctly, your sound file should play.
